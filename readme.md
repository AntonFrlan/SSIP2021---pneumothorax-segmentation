# SSIP2021 - Pneumothorax Segmentation

The primary objective of this task is identification and segmentation of chest radiographic images with pneumothorax.

Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios.

AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.
